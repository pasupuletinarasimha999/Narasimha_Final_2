What is a Jenkins agent: A Jenkins agent (or node) is a machine that is set up to offload build projects from the Jenkins master. Agents can run on different operating systems and can be configured to run specific types of jobs.
Step-by-Step Guide
	1. Configure the Jenkins Master
		Log in to Jenkins Master:
		Open your Jenkins dashboard in a web browser.
		Add a New Node:
		Go to "Manage Jenkins" -> "Manage Nodes and Clouds".
		Click on "New Node".
		Enter a name for the node and select "Permanent Agent".
		Click "OK".
		Configure Node Details:
		Enter the required details such as:
		Remote root directory: The directory on the agent machine where Jenkins will store files.
		Labels: Labels to categorize the node (optional).
		Usage: How Jenkins should use the node (e.g., "Use this node as much as possible").
		Under "Launch method", select "Launch agent by connecting it to the master".
		Save the Configuration:
		Click "Save".
	2. Set Up the Jenkins Agent
		Download the Agent JAR File:
		On the node configuration page, you will see a section called "Launch agent by connecting it to the master".
		Download the agent.jar file from the provided link.
		Transfer the JAR File to the Agent Machine:
		Transfer the agent.jar file to the agent machine using SCP, FTP, or any other file transfer method.
		Run the Agent:
		Open a terminal on the agent machine.
		Navigate to the directory where you placed the agent.jar file.
		Run the following command to start the agent:
		java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl <JENKINS_MASTER_URL>/computer/<NODE_NAME>/jenkins-agent.jnlp -secret <SECRET_KEY> -workDir "<REMOTE_ROOT_DIRECTORY>"
		Replace <JENKINS_MASTER_URL>, <NODE_NAME>, <SECRET_KEY>, and <REMOTE_ROOT_DIRECTORY> with the appropriate values from your Jenkins master configuration.
	3. Verify the Agent Connection
		Check the Node Status:
		Go back to the Jenkins dashboard.
		Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" -> "Manage Nodes and Clouds".
		You should see the new node listed and its status should be "Online".

2. How do you handle parallel execution in Jenkins Pipelines?
		pipeline {
		agent any
		stages {
			stage('Parallel Stage') {
				parallel {
					stage('Unit Tests') {
						steps {
							echo 'Running Unit Tests'
						}
					}
					stage('Integration Tests') {
						steps {
							echo 'Running Integration Tests'
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}

3. How do you back up Jenkins? -> /var/lib/jenkins
4. folder structure of /var/lib/jenkins?
	Jobs: Located in the jobs directory.
	Plugins: Located in the plugins directory.
	Configuration Files: Such as config.xml, credentials.xml, etc.
	User Content: Located in the userContent directory.
5. How do you handle credentials in Jenkins?
		Steps:
		Navigate to Credentials:
		Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials.
		Select a Domain:
		You can add credentials to the global domain or create a new domain for more granular control.
		Add Credentials:
		Click on Add Credentials.
		Select the type of credentials you want to add (e.g., Username with password, Secret text, SSH Username with private key, etc.).
		Fill in the required fields and click OK.
6. Describe multibranch pipelines in Jenkins
	Multibranch Pipelines in Jenkins are a powerful feature that allows you to automatically create and manage Jenkins jobs for multiple branches of a repository. This is particularly useful for projects that follow a branching strategy, such as GitFlow, where different branches represent different stages of development (e.g., feature branches, release branches, etc)

	Go to the Jenkins dashboard.
	Click on New Item.
	Enter a name for the job and select Multibranch Pipeline.
	Click OK.
	Configure the Multibranch Pipeline:
	Branch Sources: Add a source for your repository.
	Click on Add Source and select the type of repository (e.g., Git, GitHub, Bitbucket).
	Configure the repository URL and credentials if needed.
	Build Configuration: Specify the script path if your Jenkinsfile is not in the root directory of the repository.
	Scan Repository Triggers: Configure how often Jenkins should scan the repository for new branches and changes (e.g., periodically or based on webhook triggers).
	Save and Build:
	Save the configuration.
	Jenkins will automatically scan the repository and create jobs for each branch that contains a Jenkinsfile.
	
7. Kubernetes Cloud Configuration
	Add Kubernetes Cloud:
	Click on Add a new cloud and select Kubernetes.
	Configure Kubernetes Cloud:

	Name: Enter a name for the Kubernetes cloud.
	Kubernetes URL: Enter the URL of your Kubernetes API server.
	Kubernetes Namespace: Specify the namespace where Jenkins will create pods.
	Credentials: Add credentials for accessing the Kubernetes API (e.g., Kubernetes service account token).
	Jenkins URL: Enter the URL of your Jenkins instance.
	Jenkins Tunnel: (Optional) Specify the Jenkins tunnel if required.
	
	Pod Templates:
	Define pod templates that Jenkins will use to create agent pods in Kubernetes.
	Click on Add Pod Template.
	Name: Give your pod template a name.
	Labels: Add labels to match jobs to this pod template.
	Containers: Define the containers that will run in the pod.
	Name: Name of the container.
	Docker Image: Docker image to use for the container.
	Command to run: (Optional) Command to run in the container.
	Arguments to pass to the command: (Optional) Arguments for the command.
	Working Directory: (Optional) Working directory for the container.
	Resource Limits: (Optional) Define resource limits for the container.

8.How to connect s3 through jenkins
Step-by-Step Guide
			1. Install the S3 Plugin
			Log in to Jenkins:

			Open your Jenkins dashboard in a web browser.
			Install the S3 Plugin:
			Go to "Manage Jenkins" -> "Manage Plugins".
			Click on the "Available" tab.
			Search for "S3 Plugin".
			Check the box next to the S3 Plugin and click "Install without restart" or "Download now and install after restart".
			
			2. Configure AWS Credentials in Jenkins
			Go to Credentials:

			Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" -> "Manage Credentials".
			Add AWS Credentials:

			Select the appropriate domain (e.g., "Global").
			Click on "Add Credentials".
			Choose "AWS Credentials" from the "Kind" dropdown.
			Enter your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
			Optionally, you can add a description to identify these credentials.
			Click "OK" to save.
			
			3. Configure S3 Bucket in Jenkins Job
			Create or Configure a Jenkins Job:
			Go to your Jenkins dashboard.
			Create a new job or configure an existing one.
			Add Post-build Action:

			In the job configuration page, scroll down to the "Post-build Actions" section.
			Click on "Add post-build action".
			Select "Publish artifacts to S3 Bucket".
			Configure S3 Bucket Details:

			Profile Name: Select the AWS credentials you added earlier.
			Bucket Name: Enter the name of your S3 bucket.
			Source Files: Specify the files you want to upload to S3 (e.g., **/*.jar for all JAR files).
			Destination Bucket: Specify the destination path in the S3 bucket.
			Storage Class: Choose the storage class (e.g., STANDARD, REDUCED_REDUNDANCY).
			Upload from slave: Check this if you want to upload files from a Jenkins agent.
			Save the Configuration:

			Click "Save" to apply the changes.
			Example Configuration
			Assuming you have a job that generates a JAR file and you want to upload it to an S3 bucket named my-jenkins-bucket:

			Profile Name: aws-credentials
			Bucket Name: my-jenkins-bucket
			Source Files: **/*.jar
			Destination Bucket: builds/
			Storage Class: STANDARD
			Using AWS CLI in Jenkins Pipeline
			Alternatively, you can use the AWS CLI to interact with S3 in a Jenkins Pipeline. This method provides more flexibility and control.

			Install AWS CLI on Jenkins Master/Agent:

			Follow the AWS CLI installation guide.
			Configure AWS CLI:

			Configure the AWS CLI with your credentials using aws configure.
			Jenkins Pipeline Script:

			pipeline {
				agent any
				environment {
					AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = credentials('aws-access-key-id')
					AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = credentials('aws-secret-access-key')
				}
				stages {
					stage('Build') {
						steps {
							// Your build steps here
							echo 'Building...'
						}
					}
					stage('Upload to S3') {
						steps {
							script {
								sh 'aws s3 cp build/my-app.jar s3://my-jenkins-bucket/builds/my-app.jar'
							}
						}
					}
				}
			}
